This program is built in Visual Studio with the Windows Forms framework and features a simple TicTacToe game. It uses this framework to create a visual
for a Player Vs CPU score-based game. The first player to get 3 “X”s or “O”s in a row wins.
The CPU is based off of random generation to determine which spot it will choose.
Once someone wins the game, the scoreboard goes up by one depending on who won the game, and a new round will begin.
There is also a Restart Game option if the user wants to immediately terminate the current game and go again with a clean slate.

To run: Run the solution in Microsoft Visual Studio. This project requires the Windows Forms framework to run.
